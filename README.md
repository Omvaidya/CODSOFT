# Artificial Intelligence Projects

## Project Overview

This repository contains three separate AI projects implemented in Python. Each project showcases different aspects of AI, including a rule-based chatbot, a recommendation system, and a tic-tac-toe game. The projects can be executed in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Project Structure

- **chatbot/**: Contains the rule-based chatbot project files.
- **recommendation_system/**: Contains the recommendation system project files.
- **tic_tac_toe/**: Contains the tic-tac-toe game project files.
- **data/**: Contains the CSV file used in the recommendation system.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Prerequisites

To run these projects, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

### Required Libraries

The following Python libraries are used across the projects:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- nltk

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib nltk
```

## Project Descriptions

### 1. Rule-Based Chatbot

The rule-based chatbot responds to user commands based on predefined rules. It demonstrates basic natural language processing (NLP) and rule-based logic.

#### Running the Chatbot

1. **Navigate to the `chatbot/` directory.**
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   - **Using Jupyter Notebook:** Open the `chatbot.ipynb` file.
   - **Using Google Colab:** Upload the `chatbot.ipynb` file to Google Colab.

3. **Execute the Code:**

   Run each code cell to initialize the chatbot and interact with it through the provided interface.

### 2. Recommendation System

The recommendation system uses data from a CSV file to provide recommendations based on user input. It showcases the use of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.

#### Running the Recommendation System

1. **Navigate to the `recommendation_system/` directory.**
2. **Ensure the CSV file is in the `data/` directory.**
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   - **Using Jupyter Notebook:** Open the `recommendation_system.ipynb` file.
   - **Using Google Colab:** Upload the `recommendation_system.ipynb` file to Google Colab.

4. **Execute the Code:**

   Run each code cell to load the data, train the recommendation model, and get recommendations based on user queries.

### 3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The tic-tac-toe game allows users to play against an AI opponent. The AI uses basic game theory and decision-making algorithms to play optimally.

#### Running the Tic-Tac-Toe Game

1. **Navigate to the `tic_tac_toe/` directory.**
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   - **Using Jupyter Notebook:** Open the `tic_tac_toe.ipynb` file.
   - **Using Google Colab:** Upload the `tic_tac_toe.ipynb` file to Google Colab.

3. **Execute the Code:**

   Run each code cell to initialize the game and play against the AI opponent through the provided interface.
